This repository is created to host code written while practicing LightGBM by trying to solve the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) on Kaggle.

The code lacks comments because as I am learner my view of what I am doing changes frequently.
